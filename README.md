# Caeser-Cipher

This project is a simple web-based Caesar Cipher tool, which allows users to encode or decode a message by shifting its letters by a specific number of positions in the alphabet. The interface is user-friendly, with options to select encoding or decoding, input the message, and specify the shift amount. The output is displayed instantly when the user clicks the submit button.

HTML: Structures the page and contains the input fields, buttons, and result display area.
CSS: Styles the page to look clean and modern, with responsive design elements.
JavaScript: Implements the Caesar Cipher logic, handling user inputs and displaying the result.
How It Works:
The user selects either "Encode" or "Decode".
The user enters the message and the shift amount.
Upon clicking "Submit", the JavaScript function processes the input using the Caesar Cipher algorithm and displays the result.
